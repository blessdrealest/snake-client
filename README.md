# Snake Client Project

Snake game is a very popular video game. The game concept is simple. The player (snake) slithers around and grows by 'eating' pieces of food. As it moves and eats, it grows and eventually becomes an obstacle to itself. The goal is to grow as large as possible without hitting its own self or the side walls. If either event should happen, it would die.

This is simply a multiplayer take on the genre.

To run this client, a server side will also need to be running which can be downloaded and installed from here.
